This C++ project revolves around a priority queue implemented using a max-heap data structure. It includes a Heap class with methods for enqueueing and dequeuing print jobs based on their priorities. The PrintJob class represents individual print jobs and stores information such as priority, job number, and the number of pages to be printed. The program allows users to enqueue new print jobs, print the highest-priority job, and dequeue jobs. It also provides a simple menu-driven interface for interacting with the priority queue.
